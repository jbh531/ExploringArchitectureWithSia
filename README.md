# ExploringArchitectureWithSia
Task: To educationally explore code compilation and Computer Architecture by creating an assembler and virtual machine for SIA (Simple Instruction Architecture), a simulation of a much narrower scope RISC chip (examples of RISC chips include MIPS Assembly or ARM)

Notes:

This was created with C, at first in a Unix environment, but recently converted to compile for Windows.
I do not own the SIA documentation which can be found through google search.

Concepts Covered:

Data Structures: Arrays, Linked List
Variables and Scope: Strings, characters/integers (in bytecode format as hex), pointers
Bit operations: Left and right shifting, and/or operations, and masking on the byte level
File operations: Open and close, reading line by line until EOF found
Code compilation: Parsing, converting from C abstraction to bytecode and to English output for the user
Unit Testing: Testing for small parts of functionality, looking for various types of output
Comments: Functionality of user-created functions and lines included
